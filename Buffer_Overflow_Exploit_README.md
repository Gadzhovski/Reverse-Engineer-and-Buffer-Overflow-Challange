# Buffer Overflow Exploit for gradeGPT.x86

This Python script is developed as part of a coursework for buffer overflow penetration testing. It demonstrates the exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `gradeGPT.x86` executable. This exploit script is a practical application of skills in cybersecurity and penetration testing.

## Introduction

The script exploits identified vulnerabilities in `gradeGPT.x86`, an ELF 32-bit LSB executable. These vulnerabilities were discovered through reverse engineering using tools like Ghidra. The primary focus is to exploit buffer overflow weaknesses to demonstrate the associated risks and underscore the importance of secure coding practices.

## Vulnerability Identification

Key vulnerabilities identified in the executable include:

- **Use of `gets` Function**: In the `load_username` function, which leads to potential buffer overflows due to lack of input size checking.
- **Potential Buffer Overflow in Indirect Calls**: In the `bof_island` function, which lacks bounds checking for indirect function calls.
- **Hardcoded File Name Usage**: The application uses a hardcoded file name `h4x_those_grades!`, posing risks of file manipulation or information disclosure.

## Exploit Script

The script constructs a payload that combines a buffer fill, the address of the `bof_island` function, and shellcode to open the `/etc/passwd_dummy` file. The payload is then written to the `h4x_those_grades!` file to trigger the buffer overflow and execute the shellcode.

## Usage

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Run the script: `python3 exploit_script.py`.
3. The script will create a file `h4x_those_grades!` with the crafted payload.
